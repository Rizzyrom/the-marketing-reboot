# THE MARKETING REBOOT - Cursor Rules

## CRITICAL CONVENTIONS
- NO EMOJIS in code - use Lucide React icons only
- Every page component must include: ExclusiveHeader, ParticleSystem
- Use Lightning Bolt theme variables: --bg-primary, --text-primary, etc.
- Components use: glass-card, btn-primary, gradient-text classes
- Mobile-first responsive design with Tailwind CSS
- TypeScript strict mode - no 'any' types
- Ensure all spacing and headers are correct
- Website first needs to load in lightmode users will need to switch it to dark but it should remain throughout their entire session

## TECH STACK
- Next.js 14 App Router
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Supabase (auth & database)
- Lucide React (icons only, no emojis)

## USER ROLES
- Contributors: Invite-only, verified badge, full profiles
- Readers: Open signup, follow/save features, no public profile

## DATABASE UPDATES NEEDED
- profiles.user_role: 'contributor' | 'reader'
- profiles.is_verified: boolean
- profiles.verified_date: timestamp
- New saved_posts table: user_id, post_id, saved_at

## IMMEDIATE PRIORITIES
1. Fix auth persistence issue
2. Add user role system
3. Contributor interest form (floating button)
4. Reader-specific features (follow/unfollow)
5. CMS for contributors only
